I am a `robotics passionate` always eager to learn and grow personal and professionally. I am really interested in `Computer Vision` and Artificial Intelligence and I am experience in both `manipulation` and `mobile robotics` due to my previous work with a collaborative rehabilitation robot, a lunar rover and a dexterous hand+arm. 

I am currently based in the unique city of `London` working for `Shadow Robot` where I work very close to the robots we have, which include a 20 DOF dexterous hand and a teleopration system with hands and arms.

As a summary, I count with `almost 3` years of experience working with:
* C++
* Python
* ROS and ROS2
* Ubuntu
* Controls and Motion Planning

Here you can take a look at my skills, projects I have been working on and some hobbies. In conclusion, anything that makes me happy in this life.
