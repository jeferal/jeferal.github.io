I am a `Robotics and Software passionate` always eager to learn and grow personal and professionally. I am really interested in `Computer Vision` and Artificial Intelligence and I am experience in both `manipulation` and `navigation` due to my previous work with a collaborative rehabilitation robot, a lunar rover and a dexterous hand+arm. 

I am currently based in the city of `Barcelona` working for `Keybotic` on an fully autonomous quadruped robot for industrial inspections. At the same time I am studying a Postgraduate course on `Artificial Intelligence with Deep Learning` at the [UPC](https://www.upc.edu/ca).

As a summary, I count with `almost 4` years of experience working with:
* C++
* Python
* ROS and ROS2
* Ubuntu
* Controls and Motion Planning

Here you can take a look at my skills, projects I have been working on and some hobbies. In conclusion, anything that makes me happy in this life.
