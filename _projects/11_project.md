I remember that before starting my work on the Bachelor's Thesis I was usnure of focusing my career on robotics although it was something that really interted me before. Due to my interest in the course on `Advanced Computer Control` I asked the profesor if they were proposing any Thesis related to this in any laboratory. I was lucky enough that it was the case and this is where I started working on parallel robots for rehabilitation purposes with Marina Vall√©s.

The purpose of this Bachelor's Thesis was to implement a control architecture for 4DOF parallel robots through a `real time embedded industrial controller and an FPGA`. This controller was the `Compact-RIO` from National Instrument whose CPU and FPGA were programmable by the language `LAB-VIEW`.

I loved solving all sort of problems related to a distributed real time control architecture, such as:
* Implementing a `buffer` in the Compact Rio to store trajectory points that were sent form the host and do not lose them.
* Measuring the `latency` in the communication between the Compact Rio and the host.
* Measuing important `variables in the control loop` like: position error, control action, proportional action, derivative action, gravity compensation action, etc.
* Implementing a controller that was not only based on a PID, but also was able to `compensate gravity`.
* Creating an `abstract enough interface` to be able to test the software and hardware on `simulation` (`MATLAB / Simulink`) as if it was the real robot.

One of the advantages of using LabView is that it is very easy to create a Graphical User Interface to control the robot and also to visualize important variables in the system. This was the result:

Programming in LabView works different than a standard programming language. It basically consists of connecting blocks (functions) through wires. It was a valuable experience, but I personally prefer standard programming languages.
