Last March I attended my first event with Shadow. It was the `European Robotics Forum 2023` in `Odense (Denmark)`, a city that has had a huge impact in the robotics industry and research.
This time we showed an `unimanual teleoperation system`. This system consists basically on a dexterous hand and an arm that can be teleoperated by a human through a glove. The glove has sensors
in the fingertip, from which we can compute the movement for the fingers and also have a Vive tracker to compute the movement for the 2 joints in the wrist of the hand and also the 6 joints of the Universal Robot arm.

In this video you can see me teleoperating the robot:

We helped many people try the teloperation system so that they can experience it by themselves. One of the people who tried was my profesor from my Master's in the UPV who I was very happy to see again and helping him using the robot. I am happy that there is representation of my University in international events:

Here is also a summary of what was ERF like for the company and everyone who attended:

Finally, we got a little gift from Robotnik, a company from my home town. It is a wooden version from one of their robots!
