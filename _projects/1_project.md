I was pleased to show the `teleoperation system` in the exhibition area at the `International Conference on Robotics and Automation` (ICRA) 2023. It happened during the week of
May 29th and was located in `London`, so we did not have the need to travel this year.
Many people were interested interested in the system and they had the opportunity to try it. From my personal point of view, it was very fulfilling to see all this interest, be able
to explain how the system works and most important get to know people within the robotics world who are working with very interesting robotics as well.

I also had the opportunity of seeing the presentations of the papers that were accepted in the conference and also of seeing other stands in the exhibition area. I was surprised and happy to see
that there were many companies and research groups working with dexterous grippers and teleoperation systems of different kinds and purposes, from humanoid teleoperated robots to the da Vinci surgical system. Here you can see a video introducing a humanoid robot and our teleoperation system:
